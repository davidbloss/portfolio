          I built and optimized the tools and infrastructure used by
          OpsLevel's customers and employees.

          - I led the Platform team in a major upgrade/rewrite of
            [OpsLevel's Terrafom provider](https://github.com/OpsLevel/terraform-provider-opslevel).
            This modernization:
            - Skyrocketed [test coverage](
              https://github.com/OpsLevel/terraform-provider-opslevel/actions/workflows/tests-integration.yml
              ) from 6% up to 85%
            - Reduced development time by 40%, saving 100+ engineering hours
            - Strengthed customer trust by resolving bugs plaguing customer infrastructure
            - Provided a framework for OpsLevel's demo account used by its sales team.
          - Leveraging my Golang, GraphQL, and internal tooling development expertise:
            - I automated OpsLevel's Go API client development by designing self-generating
              code by templating a GraphQL API schema into Go data structures and methods
            - Standardized local development across 10+ projects using Taskfiles, common
              tasks were centralized then applied to CI, boosting developer productivity
            - Personally contributed majority of OpsLevel's public code changes; 85% of [Terrafom Provider](
              https://github.com/OpsLevel/terraform-provider-opslevel/graphs/contributors?from=6%2F27%2F2023&to=1%2F30%2F2025
              ), 76% of [Go API client](
              https://github.com/OpsLevel/opslevel-go/graphs/contributors?from=6%2F27%2F2023&to=1%2F30%2F2025
              ), and 56% of [cli](
              https://github.com/OpsLevel/cli/graphs/contributors?from=6%2F27%2F2023&to=1%2F30%2F2025
              )
          - While maintaining OpsLevel's Kubernetes infrastructure:
            - I performed 15 AWS EKS cluster upgrades while automating the process,
              reducing upgrade time/effort and AWS expenditures
            - Introduced [Network Policies](
              https://docs.datadoghq.com/containers/datadog_operator/
              ) for improved security
            - Set up [DataDog's Operator](
              https://docs.datadoghq.com/containers/datadog_operator/
              ) across OpsLevel's clusters
            - Diagnosed cluster issues, resource constraints, and streamlined
              alerting systems
          - Instrumental in building OpsLevel's first single-tenant AWS instance:
            - I codified AWS resources into Terrafom modules and Kubernetes manifests,
              expediting infrastructure maintenance
            - Configured cluster RBAC to use customer AWS IAM roles, removing
              OpsLevel's need to host credentials and fostering trust with
              this premium customer
            - Automated majority of setup steps, expediting onboarding experience for
              future single-tenant customers and simplifying process for OpsLevel

          write, format, and enhance their annual Enlisted Performance Report.
          The quality of these reports were instrumental in determining whether
          an enlisted member would be promoted or not. As of 2023, EPRs have
          been replaced by Enlisted Performance Brief.
