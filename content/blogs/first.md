### About Me

Professionally I'm a mix of Platfrom Engineer, Senior Software Engineer, DevOps, and
a 10-year US Air Force veteran. Oh, Blockbuster Video? Yep, worked there too, no biggie.

I grew up in the SF Bay Area skateboarding where a fantastic artist drew the above image
from a picture of me, by hand no less.

### Blog Content
